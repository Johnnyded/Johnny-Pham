- ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Johnny Pham
- ðŸ‘€ I currently attend CSULB as a BS Computer Science student with a set graduation in the Fall of 2023
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on creating and deploying a personal website loaded with my own personal touches to give it some zaz!
- I really enjoy getting to the bottom of things and understanding how things work the way they do and what better field to do that in than in CS
